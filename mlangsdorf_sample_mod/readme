This is a mod for Harebrained Scheme's Battletech 2018 video game.

It is a relatively simple mod that demonstrates how to use ModTek to change
existing mechs, add new mechs, and alter other game files.

It does several things:
* StreamingAssets/data/chassis/chassisdef_kintaro_KTO-18.json reduces the
speed of the Kintaro chassis to 4, giving it more available tonnage and
creating a 55 ton mech that isn't moderately fast.
* StreamingAssets/data/chassis/chassisdef_catapult_CPLT-C1.json gives the
-C1 Catapult access to all three missile hardpoints on each arm that are
already defined in the existing hardpoints/hardpointdatadef_catapult.json
file.
* StreamingAssets/data/mech/mechdef_kintaro_KTO-18.json adds 4 jump jets
and upgrades the kintaro's LRM-5 to an LRM-10.
* mymech and mychassis add 5 "new" mech designs based on existing 
images. The new mechs are:
** Valkyrie 30 ton missile sniper/scout based on the Panther art assets
** Phoenix Hawk 45 ton heavy scout based on the Panther art assets
** Rifleman 60 ton long range fire support mech based on the Jagermech 
art assets.
** Archer 70 ton missile mech based on the Awesome art assets.
** Marauder 75 ton fire support mech based on the Cataphract art assets.
* StreamingAssets/data/simGameConstants/SimGameConstants.json changes the
staring mech line up so the player has a Phoenix Hawk and his lance
includes a Valkyrie. It also makes a couple of minor changes to make the
game slightly more challenging.

I hope people will be able to use this mod as a base for their own efforts
in modding Battletech.
